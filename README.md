This assignment really threw me off at the start. I had initially missed the tutorial where how to begin the task was explained so I was immediately at a disadvantage, however, it was quickly explained and I had everything setup to start writing my webpage. The thing that most confused me was the interconnection of markdown with the usual HTML and CSS documents. When at the start and even well into designing my website I often confused myself over when to use markdown or HTML, especially which HTML page to use as there were multiple for the one webpage.

My webpage is based off of a 2020 Canberra Art Biennale artist. The page is meant to represent what a portfolio site homepage might look like for the artist. I tried to mimic the original contour website’s design somewhat, using just black and white as well as slab sans-serif fonts to create boldness and professionalism. As such I didn’t need to use many complicated techniques in my design. I used pretty much the same sort of elements in my previous assignment, such as the sticky header. Overall I think the page came out clean, however due to the limit of one webpage I felt as if I was limited, not wanting to clutter the homepage and instead spread it out across a full website.
